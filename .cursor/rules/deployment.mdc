# Deployment

## GitHub Actions Workflows

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD with mise integration.

### Workflow Files
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Runs on pull requests
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml` - Deploys to GitHub Pages on main branch

### CI Workflow (Pull Requests)
Located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Triggers**: On pull request

**Steps**:
1. Checkout code
2. Setup mise (using `jdx/mise-action@v2`)
3. Build site with `mise run build`

This ensures all PRs can build successfully before merging.

### Publish Workflow (Deployment)
Located at `.github/workflows/publish.yml`

**Triggers**: 
- Push to `main` branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Steps**:
1. Checkout code
2. Configure GitHub Pages
3. Setup mise (using `jdx/mise-action@v2`)
4. Build site with `mise run build`
5. Upload artifact (from `public/` directory)
6. Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Mise Integration in CI/CD

Both workflows use the `jdx/mise-action@v2` action which:
- Automatically installs mise
- Reads `.mise.toml` configuration
- Installs Hugo v0.104.1 (as specified in `.mise.toml`)
- Makes mise tasks available

**Benefits**:
- Hugo version is centrally managed in `.mise.toml`
- No need to duplicate version numbers in workflows
- Consistent tooling between local development and CI/CD
- Easy to update Hugo version (just change `.mise.toml`)

### Deployment Target
- **Platform**: GitHub Pages
- **URL**: Configured in repository settings
- **Source**: `gh-pages` branch (managed by GitHub Actions)

## Making Changes

### For Content Updates
1. Create a branch
2. Make changes locally
3. Test with `mise run dev`
4. Push branch and create PR
5. CI will verify build succeeds
6. Merge to `main` to deploy

### For Configuration Changes
1. Update `.mise.toml`, `config.toml`, or workflow files
2. Test locally first
3. Follow PR process
4. Monitor deployment after merge

## Troubleshooting Deployments

If deployment fails:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs in the repository
2. Verify `mise run build` works locally
3. Ensure Hugo version in `.mise.toml` is correct
4. Check for broken links or missing assets
