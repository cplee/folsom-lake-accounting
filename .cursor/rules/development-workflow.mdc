# Development Workflow

## Using Mise for Development

All development tasks are managed through mise. The configuration is in `.mise.toml`.

## Available Tasks

### Start Development Server
```bash
mise run dev
```

This command:
- Runs `hugo server -D`
- Starts a local server at http://localhost:1313
- Enables live reload
- Includes draft content (`-D` flag)
- Watches for file changes and automatically rebuilds

### Build for Production
```bash
mise run build
```

This command:
- Runs `hugo --minify`
- Builds the site to the `public/` directory
- Minifies HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Optimizes for production deployment

## Development Best Practices

1. **Always use mise tasks** instead of running Hugo directly to ensure version consistency
2. **Test locally** with `mise run dev` before pushing changes
3. **Check build output** with `mise run build` to verify minification works correctly
4. The development server supports **hot reload** - changes appear instantly in the browser

## File Watching
Hugo's development server watches:
- Content files
- Template files in `/themes/graysx/layouts/`
- Static assets in `/static/`
- Data files in `/data/`
- Configuration in `config.toml`

## Common Development Tasks

### Making Content Changes
1. Start dev server: `mise run dev`
2. Edit files in `/data/homepage.yml` or theme templates
3. Changes appear automatically in browser
4. Test thoroughly before committing

### Updating Theme
1. Modify files in `/themes/graysx/`
2. Changes are reflected immediately with dev server running
3. Test responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility

### Adding Images
1. Place images in `/static/assets/img/`
2. Reference in templates or data files
3. Consider image optimization for web performance
