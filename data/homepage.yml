    I'm Karen Lee, CPA and long time Folsom resident. My passion is helping others. For small businesses, accounting can be stressful and confusing. 
    For individuals, communication with the IRS and FTB can be intimidating. 
    I find joy helping small businesses and individuals navigate accounting challenges without stress. 
    Whether you are a small business owner or an individual needing accounting services, I would love to help.

    title: "Tax Planning and Strategy"
    text: >
      I offer comprehensive tax planning to find every available tax strategy to reduce your taxes based on your specific situation.
      Most people only think of taxes once a year when they are legally required to file their tax return. Unfortunately, your annual
      tax return is just a reflection of what has already happened in the past year.<br/>
      
      Alternatively, tax planning is a proactive year round approach. I look at the bigger picture and offer forward looking tax planning
      strategies to reduce your taxes. I can help you implement the strategies that are available to you as well as maintain and monitor
      your compliance throughout the year.<br/>
      
      The purpose of tax planning is to lower your overall tax liability. My goal is to help you achieve that when
      it comes time to file your annual tax return.

    title: "Tax Resolution/Relief"
    text: >
      I help clients resolve their tax problems with compassion and understanding. I understand the stress of dealing with the IRS,
      especially if you have received a notice that says you are out of compliance or owe money. </br>

      I will help you understand what the notice means and how to handle it. Some notices might have been sent in error, others might
      require a simple call to the IRS or the notice might be more complicated and require prompt attention and a plan. <br/>
      
      Folsom Lake Accounting will help you determine what the next steps should be. If you have received a notice you are unsure how
      to handle, please contact myself or another CPA who handles tax resolution as soon as possible to make sure you donâ€™t miss
      an important deadline.
