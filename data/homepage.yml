    I'm Karen Lee, CPA and long time Folsom resident. My passion is helping others. For small businesses, accounting can be stressful and confusing.  
    For individuals, communication with the IRS and FTB can be intimidating.  
    I find joy helping small businesses and individuals navigate accounting challenges without stress. 
    Whether you are a small business owner or an individual needing accounting services, I would love to help.

      A significant number of businesses are eligible for Employee Retention Credits (ERC) and 
      have not yet claimed them.  The credits are there to help small businesses that were impacted by COVID.  
      I can help you determine if you are eligible and if you are, help you claim them.
