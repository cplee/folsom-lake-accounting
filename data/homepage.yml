    I'm Karen Lee, CPA and long time Folsom resident. My passion is helping others. For small businesses, accounting can be stressful and confusing. 
    For individuals, communication with the IRS and FTB can be intimidating. 
    I find joy helping small businesses and individuals navigate accounting challenges without stress. 
    Whether you are a small business owner or an individual needing accounting services, I would love to help.
