    I'm Karen Lee, CPA and long time Folsom resident. My passion is helping others. For small businesses, accounting can be stressful and confusing.  
    For individuals, communication with the IRS and FTB can be intimidating.  
    I find joy helping small businesses and individuals navigate accounting challenges without stress. 
    Whether you are a small business owner or an individual needing accounting services, I would love to help.

    title: "Tax Resolution/Relief"
    text: >
      I help clients resolve their tax problems with compassion and understanding.  I understand the stress of dealing with the IRS,
      especially if you have received a notice that says you are out of compliance or owe money. </br>

      I will help you understand what the notice means and how to handle it.  Some notices might have been sent in error, others might
      require a simple call to the IRS or the notice might be more complicated and require prompt attention and a plan. <br/>
      
      Folsom Lake Accounting will help you determine what the next steps should be.  If you have received a notice you are unsure how
      to handle, please contact myself or another CPA who handles tax resolution as soon as possible to make sure you donâ€™t miss
      an important deadline.
