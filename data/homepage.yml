    I'm Karen Lee and my passion is helping others. For small businesses, accounting can be stressful and confusing.  
    For individuals, communication with the IRS and FTB can be intimidating.  
    I find joy helping small business and individuals navigate accounting challenges without stress. 
    Whether you are a small business owner or an individual needing accounting services, I would love to help.

      A significant number of businesses are eligible for Employee Retention Credits and 
      have not yet claimed them.  The credits are there to help small businesses that were impacted by COVID.  
      I can help you determine if you are eligible and if you are, help you claim them.
